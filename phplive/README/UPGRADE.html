PHP LIVE! SUPPORT UPGRADE PROCEDURES
===========================================

If you have already installed PHP Live!, please follow these steps to upgrade your system.  The upgrading of
PHP Live! requires replacing your current PHP Live! files to that of the newly downloaded PHP Live! files.
Before you start, please note the following possible issues to streamline the process.

THINGS TO NOTE BEFORE UPGRADING

* Take a moment to review the important notes regarding modified PHP Live! systems

* Possible FTP program settings

Some FTP programs may have a setting to "override" an empty directory rather than "merge" or "skip" the empty
directory.  You'll want to set the setting to "merge" or "skip" so that the newly downloaded empty phplive/web/
directory does not replace your current web/ directory containing the configuration files.  Most FTP programs
should have "merge" or "skip" by default.

* If the above FTP setting cannot be located

If the above FTP setting cannot be located, before upgrading (FTP), remove the NEWLY downloaded empty phplive/web/
directory.  This will ensure the above FTP issue will not happen.  As a safe measure, this should be done anyway.
Your server copy of the phplive/web/ directory should not be altered in any way.



upgrading steps:
	[ FTP METHOD ]

	- open an FTP connection to your web server
	- change directory to where PHP Live! is installed
	--- [note] make sure you are not inside the phplive/ directory but one level up
	- ftp this ENTIRE phplive/ folder to your current phplive/ system
	- if asked to "override" or "replace", choose "yes" to override all previous files
	- when FTP of files has finished, upgrade process has completed
	- proceed to login to your PHP Live! setup area to check that everything is working
	- done!

	[ DIRECT SERVER INSTALL - SHELL ]

	- change directory to where phplive/ is located
	--- [note] make sure you are not inside the phplive/ directory but one level up
	- copy or move the newly download PHP Live! compressed file to this location
	- unzip/untar the compressed package
	- if asked to "override" or "replace", choose "yes" to override all previous files
	- proceed to login to the setup area to check that everything is working
	- done!
