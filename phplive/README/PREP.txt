PHP LIVE! MANUAL PRE INSTALL STEPS
===========================================

A server may require a manual pre installation step due to the nature
of the server's configuration. These steps are generally not required
UNLESS you were directed here from the web installer.

Please refer to the INSTALL.txt

-------------------------------------------

Step 1.
----------------
Remove ALL the files and folders located in the phplive/web/ directory.
It is important that the phplive/web/ directory is completely empty.


Step 2.
----------------
In the phplive/web/ directory, create the following sub directories:

chat_initiate
chat_sessions
patches


Step 3.
----------------
Set the permissions on all of the folders you've just created to be
fully read and writeable by the web server.

[ METHODS TO SET PERMISSIONS ]

* COMMAND LINE METHOD
On a unix systems the permissions will need to be 777. A quick
command to set the permissions:

% chmod -R 777 phplive/web/

* WINDOWS SERVER METHOD
On a Windows IIS system you will need to set the NTFS permissions for the
phplive/web/ directory and it's contents to "Full Control" for the Web
User account and also set the write permission on the created sub folders.

* FTP METHOD
Right click on each of the folders created and choose the "File Permissions"
or "Permissions".  Then check ALL the boxes and submit.  Make sure you do
this for the directories created (chat_initate, chat_sessions, patches) and
double check that the phplive/web/ has all permissions chcked as well.


Step 4.
----------------
You can now attempt the PHP Live! web installation again. Once you have
completed the installation, your PHP Live! system should function as normal.
