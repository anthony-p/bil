PHP LIVE! MANUAL PRE INSTALL STEPS
===========================================

A server may require a manual pre installation step due to the nature of the server's configuration. These
steps are generally not required UNLESS you were directed here from the web installer.

Please refer to the INSTALL.txt

-------------------------------------------

Step 1.
----------------
Remove ALL the files and folders located in the phplive/web/ directory.
It is important that the phplive/web/ directory is completely empty.


Step 2.
----------------
In the phplive/web/ directory, create the following sub directories:

chat_initiate
chat_sessions
patches


Step 3.
----------------
Set the permissions on all of the folders you've just created to be fully read and writeable by the web server.

[ METHODS TO SET PERMISSIONS ]

* COMMAND LINE METHOD

On a unix systems the permissions will need to be 777. A quick
command to set the permissions:

% chmod -R 777 phplive/web/


* WINDOWS SERVER METHOD

On a Windows IIS system, set the NTFS permissions for the phplive/web/ directory and its contents
to "Full Control" for the Web User account.  Double check that the folders created
(chat_initiate, chat_sessions, patches) are also set to full contol.


* FTP METHOD

Right click on each of the folders created and choose the "File Permissions" or "Permissions".  Check ALL the
boxes and submit.  Double check the parent folder phplive/web/ has all permissions checked as well.


Step 4.
----------------
Continue once again with the PHP Live! web installation by accessing your PHP Live! URL. (example: www.YourSite.com/phplive)
